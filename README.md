# FCB-group-13-Project
This is a collaborative group work i led during the future clan bootcamp in Data Analysis class. We were given an assignment to gather Dataset for the area of Real Estate, analyze and create a report out of it. After much collation and deliberation, we resolve to working on a Lekki housing data to know the determination of cost of houses there.
